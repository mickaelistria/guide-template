##### Advice
Plastic sheet will be use for the screen. You should avoid to get one thicker than 0.25mm otherwise the result will be blur because [Pepper's ghost effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost) appear on each side.



## Steps
1. Join part 1 and 2 of your template according to the legend
2. Glue the full template onto cardboard
3. Cut out the cardboard following each continuous line (every thin continuous line)
4. Fold for each arrow (in any order) to the correct side according to the legend
5. Cut the inside part - bold continuous line (this steps after first folding because removing inside part make the cardboard weaker)
6. Put your rubber band around the cardboard according to the legend for the location
7. Break the flat stir stick to make it 135mm
8. Tap the transparent plastic sheet to the flat stir stick
9. Construct the headset by folding again but following the ordered numbers
  - Add some adhesive right after number **1** and **7**
  - Insert the plastic sheet with the flat stir stick just before number ****
