_Cheap Augmented Reality Tool_

This DIY project aim to provide an easy and cheap way to get your own augmented reality headset.

Before starting be sure you have all the tools and materials needed.

## Tools
- [ ] Utility knife
- [ ] Scissor
- [ ] Ruler
- [ ] Glue stick

## Materials
- [ ] Printed template (that you can find here)
- [ ] 2 piece of cardboard - 380x260mm and 240x170mm
- [ ] Mirror - 60x60mm
- [ ] Transparent plastic sheet - 105x50mm
- [ ] Sponge
- [ ] Flat stir stick
- [ ] Stretch utility strap
- [ ] Rubber band
- [ ] Adhesive tap

##### Advice
Plastic sheet will be use for the screen. You should avoid to get one thicker than 0.25mm otherwise the result will be blur because [Pepper's ghost effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost) appear on each side.



## Steps
1. Join part 1 and 2 of your template according to the legend
2. Glue the full template onto cardboard
3. Cut out the cardboard following each continuous line (every thin continuous line)
4. Fold in any order for each arrow to the right side according to the legend
5. Cut the inside part - bold continuous line (this steps after first folding because removing inside part make the cardboard weaker)
6. Construct the headset by folding again but following the ordered numbers
  - Add some adhesive right after number **1** and **7**
